        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, saute rice with butter. Add chicken broth and 
                simmer over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until rice is cooked
                and tender. Let cool.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat over to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cube 3/4 pound of the cheese; shred the remaining 1/4 pound cheese
                and set aside. Combine chicken, 3/4 pound cubed cheese, corn, cooled
                rice and 1/4 cup sauce in a large bowl. Mix together. Warm tortillas 
                in the microwave for 2 minutes and spread another 1/4 cup sauce in the 
                bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>Place a little of the chicken mixture on each tortilla and roll up. Place
                filled tortillas (as many as will fit) in the baking dish. Sprinkle with 1/4 
                pound shredded cheese and top with any remaining sauce, pouring evenly over all.
