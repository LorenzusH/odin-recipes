    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle warm beer</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed</li>
        <li>16 sticks string cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar, salt,
                garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough 
                hook attachment: mix until combined. With the mixer running, add remaining flour,
                a little at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms
                into a ball, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl.
                Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion
                onto a prepared pan. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan. If dough shrinks back
                when stretched, cover and let rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.
            </li>
            <li>Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang
                over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with second pan.
            </li>
        </ol>
